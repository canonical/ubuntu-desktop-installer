This project is a modern implementation of the Ubuntu Desktop installer, using [subiquity](https://github.com/canonical/subiquity) as a backend and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for the UI.

## Availability

The new Ubuntu Desktop installer is *planned* to ship with the next Ubuntu Desktop LTS 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish.

## Test a live image

If you want to test the new installer before 22.04 goes live, you can download a preview canary image below and install it for example in a virtual machine:

## Building and running manually

If you prefer to build and run the installer from source you need to install Flutter.

### Either: Install Flutter with Snapd

```
sudo snap install flutter --classic
```

### Or: installer Flutter manually

Please follow the [official Linux setup instructions from flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux) to install Flutter and its dependencies for the Linux desktop support manually.

### Configure Flutter

NOTE: Notice to enable desktop support for Flutter:

```
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
```

### Download and build the Ubuntu Desktop installer

Grab the source:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-installer.git
cd ubuntu-desktop-installer
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install Subiquity dependencies:
```sh
cd packages/subiquity_client/subiquity
sudo ./scripts/installdeps.sh
```

### Run the installer

Run the installer either from within your IDE or by running the following command:

```sh
flutter run
```

### Run live installer

In one terminal run:
```sh
cd /path/to/ubuntu-desktop-installer/packages/subiquity_client/subiquity
sudo python3 -m subiquity.cmd.server
```

In another terminal run:
```sh
cd /path/to/ubuntu-desktop-installer/packages/ubuntu_desktop_installer
