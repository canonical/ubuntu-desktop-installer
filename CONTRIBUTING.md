## Translations

Translations for the Ubuntu desktop installer are managed with [Flutter's tools for internationalization](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization).

The template containing all the messages to be translated lives in `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`. When starting translations for a new language, that file needs to be copied to `lib/l10n/app_LANGCODE.arb` (e.g. `lib/l10n/app_fr.arb`), and messages should be translated in this new file.

When new messages are added in the source code, they also need to be added to the translation template.

The translation template has one special string (`languageName`) that is used to determine whether that language should be offered to the user on the welcome screen. If a translation isn't complete enough, or of insufficient quality, just make `languageName` an empty string (by default it inherits the value from the English template, so it's not empty), and it won't show up as available in the UI.

## Code Generation

This project uses [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) and
[json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) to generate
immutable data classes with JSON serialization support. Adding new types or
members to classes annotated with `@freezed` or `@JsonSerializable` requires
the code to be re-generated (see also the Melos section below):

```
melos run generate
```

## Melos

The project provides a [Melos](https://docs.page/invertase/melos) configuration
to make it straightforward to execute certain tasks across the project tree.

Install Melos:
```
dart pub global activate melos
```

Bootstrap the workspace:
```
melos bootstrap
```

Select a task interactively:
```
melos run
```

Run a specific task directly:
```
melos run coverage
```
